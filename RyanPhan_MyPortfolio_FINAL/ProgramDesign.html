<h1>Program Design</h1>

<p>
    In this tutorial, we'll cover some ways to help plan out your OOP-Based projects!<br>
</p>

<h3>Class Hierarchy Tree</h3>
<p>
    A class hierarchy tree is a great way to help visualize the hierarchy of your classes. We can't just make a blueprint without
	planning out what will be in it! From here, you can
	organize your super and subclasses. Take for example the <code>Human</code> class in our OOP tutorials. What classes inherit it?
	Well we had <code>Student</code> and <code>Teacher</code>. <code>Student</code> had two other classes inheriting it: 
	<code>CollegeStudent</code> and <code>HighSchoolStudent.</code><br><br>
	
	Here's how we would visualize such a project:
	<img class = "center" src = "ClassTreeExample.png" height = "500" width = "500">
</p>

<h3>Unified Modeling Language (UML)</h3>
<p>
	Similar to a class hierarchy tree, UMLs allow us to plan out and model our projects before hand. A UML has three portions to it,
	the class name, the class variables, and the methods and constructors of the class. Using <code>[+]</code> prior to identifier indicates public while
	<code>[-]</code> indicates private. <code>[#]</code> indicates protected access. When something is delcared as protected, this essentially means
	that the subclasses of the class that contains that variable or method can access it. Combined, each of these components would resemble this
	template:
	
	<img class = "center" src = "UMLTemplate.png" height = "1000" width = "1000">

	
	Each of these tables represent a single class. In order to visualize the 
    relationship between classes, UML diagrams use arrows, with the subclasses pointing up to the 
	superclasses that they inherit from. Below is an example of a UML diagram for a group of classes
	that represent various types of shapes. The open arrows represent inheritance, with each of our
	<code>Shape</code> subclasses pointing at it, indicating that they extend that class.
	
	<img class = "center" src = "ShapeUML.png" height = "1200" width = "1200">
