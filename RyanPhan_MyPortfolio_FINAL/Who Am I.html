<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
<p>
    Based on the results of two personality
    tests I have taken, it seems that I am a “Guardian” and
    “ESFJ”. These tests can be found at https://profile.keirsey.com/#/b2c/assessment/start and
	 http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp. 
	According to the Myers Briggs personality criteria, ESFJ places my
    personality type as an extrovert, I tend to perceive things using my senses, I
    weigh decisions using my feelings and I prefer to be organized and structured.
    According the personality test, being a
    “Guardian” generally means that I am a practical person who abides by the rules
    and can cooperate with others.
</p>

<p>
    With regards to my potential career
    paths, I seem well suited to leadership-style jobs, as I tend to take on the
    role of the practical leader in the workplace. I work best under circumstances
    where things are clear, predictable, and structured. In addition, I tend to find
    satisfaction in my job when I am able to help others and that my work is
    appreciated by others. Thus, jobs with human interaction and feedback tend to
    suit me well. Potential jobs include those in the medical sector and social
    work. Teaching is also a suitable role for people with my personality type. A
    role as an administrator also suits my personality type. Essentially, any role
    within important social institutions such as hospitals or schools, where there
    is also a structured and organized layout suits me.
</p>

<p>
    Based on the strengths and weaknesses of ESFJs, it seems as if I would
    learn best in group based situations, where the expectations of the group are
    clearly outlined. One skill mentioned in my results was the skill of connecting
    with others. I learn best by talking to others about certain concepts and
    ideas, as it gives me an opportunity to learn from others as well as gaining
    new perspectives on certain ideas. As ESFJs learn best in group-based
    situations, it is fair to assume that I my learning style is a fairly even mix
    of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic styles, as all three of these learning
    styles are employed in group based situations.
</p>

<p>
    For my personal evaluation on my results, I personally believe that
    my results are partially accurate. Overall, most of the skills and traits that
    “Guardians” and ESFJs possess suit me, with a few outliers. Two major negative
    outliers that I noticed were the handling of criticism and opinions on change.
    According to one of the websites, ESFJs are “vulnerable to criticism”, which I
    find is only partially true for me. While I admit that at times I can become
    defensive, in the end I usually end up listening to and accepting the criticism
    of others, as opposed to being hurt in reaction to criticism. As for opinions
    on change, “Guardians” are stated to be “not very comfortable winging it or
    blazing new trails”, which I find is untrue for myself, as I often find myself
    in situations where I need to think on my feet and improvise, as there are
    times when plans end up not going as planned. One positive outlier that I
    sometimes seem to lack is sensitivity, as sometimes I accidentally end up
    offending or hurting others since I tend to be quite blunt at times. All in
    all, I did find that the rest of the traits that “Guardians” and ESFJs suit me
    to a certain extent.
