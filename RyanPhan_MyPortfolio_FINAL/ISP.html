    <h2>My Contributions</h2>
    <p>
        Prior to the creation of <i>Distraction Action</i>, we were given our final project:
        Create an educational game to teach the player about overcoming adversity. Thus, Kevin
        and I settled on an issue we knew plagued us and many other students: Distractions. Our goal
        was to make a educational, but fun game to teach students aged 14-18, about the path to overcoming
        distractions. In order to achieve this goal, I made several contributions to the creation of the game.
        First off, our company needed a logo, which I designed the main elements of. In the initial planning
        stage, I designed the storyboard of the game, which mostly resembles the final product of our game.
        During the programming stages of the game, I wrote the splash screen and the main menu.
        With regards to the actual levels of the game, I wrote the mechanics of level one and
        I wrote level three. During the process, I worked closely with Kevin regarding the direction
        and design of our game. After a month of hard work, I can firmly say that I'm proud of
        what Kevin and I have achieved, and if you play this game, I really hope you enjoy it.

                knowledge of distractions and how to avoid
                them by using the WASD keys dodge
                distractions, get boosts, and collect documents.
                Your goal is to collect 10 documents to finish
                your essay and get the highest mark possible.
                Every time you get hit by a distraction, you will
                lose focus, as indicated by the focus bar in the
                top left. If you lose all of your focus before
                collecting 10 documents, you will be forced to
                stop and hand in whatever you have of your
                essay for a lower mark.
