<h1>Arrays and ArrayList</h1>

<h3>Arrays</h3>

<h2>What is an Array?</h2>

<p>
    Let's say you want to store all of the names and ages of the people in your classroom/workplace into variables.
    Wouldn't it be really tedious to create variables and assign each value to a variable? That's
    a lot of variable names to keep track of! That's why we have arrays, as they are used to store several elements
    of the same data type in one nice little variable. Now, how would we declare an array? To do this,
    you would declare the type of elements you want in your array, like <code>int</code>
    or <code>String</code>, then you would place <code>[]</code>. Since an array is an object, you'll
    need to use the keyword <code>new</code> when you initialize it. Afterward, you put the type of elements
    that will be stored in the array, followed by <code>[]</code> with the array size in it. Note that
    the array size is fixed once initialized.<br>


<pre class="prettyprint">
    int[] ages = new int[20];
    String[] names = new String[20];
</pre>
</p>

<h2>How would I put elements into an Array?</h2>
<p>
    You can put elements into an array through an <strong>initializer list</strong>. To do this
    all you new to do is use curly braces "<code>{ }</code>" and put your elements inside, separated
    by commas.

<pre class="prettyprint">
    int[] ages = {27, 29, 40, 32, 44, 37}; // And so on...
    String[] names = {"Dave", "Bob", "Jeff", "Michelle", "Sofia"};
</pre>

<p>
    Another way to add elements to an array would be using the index of the array. To do this,
    you would call the name of the array and use "<code>[]</code>" with the index of the array
    inside the brackets. Remember that arrays start at 0. Using this, you could fill the array using
    loops. In the below example, we fill the array with random ages using Math.random() and
    a loop. When using a loop,
    know that <code>length</code> is a variable not a method, and is not followed by parenthesis. The
    indices of an array go from 0 to <code>arrayName.length - 1</code>.

<pre class="prettyprint">
/*
 * REMEMBER: The loop must terminate by your array length subtracted by 1, or
 *           it will throw the dreaded IndexOutOfBounds error.
 *
 * The (int)(Math.random() * 23 + 18) returns a random integer from 18 to 60.
 *
 */
public static void randomizeAges ()
{
    for (int x = 0 ; x < ages.length ; x++)
    {
        ages [x] = (int) (Math.random () * 43 + 18);
    }
}

</pre>
</p>

<h2>Array Traversal</h2>
<p>
    In order to traverse an array for whatever reason, may it be to modify, access, or replace
    elements, use a for loop. If you only need to access elements in the array, a for-each loop
    will do. Never use a for each loop to remove or replace elements.
    However, if you have an array of objects, keep in mind that you can use a
    for-each loop to modify this objects through their mutator methods.

<pre class="prettyprint">
  /*
   * Returns the number of people with ages below or equal to 30.
   */
  public static int underThirty (int[] ages)
  {
    int count = 0;
    for (int age : ages) // for each age in array ages
      if (age <= 30)
      count++;
    return count;
  }


  public static void main (String[] args)
  {
    int[] ages = {8, 19, 20, 32, 44, 67};
    System.out.println (underThirty (ages));

  }
</pre>
<p>
    Outputs:
</p>
<table>
    <td>
        <pre>
3
        </pre>
    </td>
</table>
<h2>Arrays as Parameters</h2>
<p>
    An important thing to know about array is that they are treated like <strong>
    objects</strong>. Thus, when you pass an array into a method, you are passing
    its object reference. While the array being used in the method
    may have a different identifier, <strong>any changes made to it will affect
    the original array object.</strong>
    To demonstrate this, let's combine our randomizing loop from before and generate
    some new ages.

<pre class="prettyprint">
    /*
     * @return the number of people with ages below or equal to 30.
     */
    public static void addAges (int[] addAges)
    {
        for (int x = 0 ; x < addAges.length ; x++)
        {
            addAges [x] += 100;
        }
    }


    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        int[] ages = {27, 29, 40, 32, 44, 37};
        addAges(ages);
        for (int x = 0 ; x < ages.length ; x++)
        {
            System.out.println (ages [x]);
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
    Output:

<table>
    <td>
        <pre>
127
129
140
132
144
137
        </pre>
    </td>
</table>
<p>
    As you can see, all of our ages stored in the <code>ages</code> array
    are now over 100!
</p>

<h3>2D Arrays / Matrices</h3>
<p>
    While you can have arrays in any dimension you want (except negatives), more often than
    not you'll be dealing with 2D arrays. So let's take a quick look at how they work.
</p>
<h2>Declaration</h2>
<p>
    Very much the same as a regular 1D array, but this time we use two <code>[]</code>s.
    You can think of 2D arrays as a grid of coordinates, just like in math. Just as
    (y,x) instead of (x,y).
    The first <code>[]</code> contains the y values, or the rows, and the second block
    contains the x values, or the number of rows.
    Both of the following create a 2D array that is a 3 x 4 integer matrix.
<pre class="prettyprint">
    int[] grid = new int[3][4]; // Initializes an 3x4 array
    int[] matrix = {{0, 1, 2, 3},
                    {3, 4, 5, 6},
                    {6, 7, 8, 9}}; // Initializes an filled 3x4 array
</pre>
<p>
    As you may have noticed, a 2D array is essentially an array of 1D arrays! That's
    why we can use the length variable in the same manner as 1D arrays. However, simply
    using .length alone only returns the number of rows. If you want the number
    of columns, you need to specify the row number.

<pre class="prettyprint">
    int[] table = new int[3][4]; // Initializes an 3x4 array
    System.out.println(table.length);     // number of rows in the array
    System.out.println(table[0].length);  // number of columns in the array
</pre>
<p>
    Outputs:
</p>
<table>
    <td>
        <pre>
    3
    4
        </pre>
    </td>
</table>
<p>This way of working with 2D array grants us the ability to use ragged arrays,
    or arrays with an inconsistent number of columns in each row. <br>
    We can now do this:
<pre class="prettyprint">
    int[] matrix = {{0, 1},
                    {3, 4, 5, 6},
                    {6, 7, 8}}; // Initializes an filled 3x4 array
    System.out.println (matrix[0].length); // number of columns in the first row
    System.out.println (matrix[1].length); // number of columns in the second row
    System.out.println (matrix[2].length); // number of columns in the third row
</pre>
<p>
    Outputs:
<table>
    <td>
        <pre>
    2
    4
    3
        </pre>
    </td>
</table>

<h2>Traversal</h2>
<p>
    Since we now know that a 2D array acts like an array of arrays,
    We can now use this to our advantage to help us access every element
    of our array, even if we have a ragged array. All we need to do is create
    two loops, one which goes through our rows and another nested one which
    checks each column in the row.
    Let's print out our previous array of integers onto the screen.

<pre class="prettyprint">
    int[][] matrix = {{0, 1},
                      {3, 4, 5, 6},
                      {6, 7, 8}}; // Initializes an filled 3x4 array
    for (int i = 0 ; i < matrix.length ; i++) { // loops through rows
        for (int j = 0 ; j < matrix[i].length ; j++) { // loops through columns in i row
            System.out.print (matrix[i][j] + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
</pre>
<p>
    Or if you prefer for-each loops:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
    for (int[] row: matrix)// for each row array in matrix
    {
      for (int element: row) // for each element in row
        System.out.print (element + " ");
      System.out.println();
    }
</pre>
<p>
    Both output:
</p>
<table>
    <td>
        <pre>
    0 1
    3 4 5 6
    6 7 8
        </pre>
    </td>
</table>


<h3>ArrayList</h3>

<h2>What is an ArrayList?</h2>
<p>
    Similar to arrays, an array list is an object capable of storing large sums of data. The primary difference
    between the two is that unlike arrays, the length or capacity of an <code>ArrayList</code> can be changed. However, the downside
    is
    that <code>ArrayList</code>s <strong>
    cannot store primitive data types, such as int, double, and char.</strong> If you want to store one of these
    data types, you can use their corresponding <strong>wrapper class</strong>. Some example of wrapper classes include
    the <code>Integer</code>, <code>Double</code>, <code>Character</code> classes.
</p>

<h2>Initializing an ArrayList</h2>
<p>
    Since <code>ArrayList</code>s are objects, we'll need to declare it like an object, using the <code>new</code> keyword. The
    capacity can be set within the <code>()</code> but the default capacity is 10. In this
    example, lets declare a to-do list for your very productive self.
<pre class="prettyprint">
    List&lt;String&gt; toDoList = new <code>ArrayList</code>&lt;String&gt;(); // initial capacity of 10
</pre>
<p>
    Now you maybe wondering, why declare our <code>ArrayList</code> with <code>List</code>? We do this because it allows use to
    change
    our implementation of <code>List</code> easily, in the event we wanted something other than an
    <code>ArrayList</code>,
    like a <code>LinkedList</code>. If we had done:
<pre class="prettyprint">
    <code>ArrayList</code>&lt;String&gt; toDoList = new <code>ArrayList</code>&lt;String&gt;(); // Also creates an <code>ArrayList</code>
</pre>
<p>
    It would have been very tedious to change every instance of the <code>ArrayList</code> to <code>LinkedList</code>.
</p>

<h2>Methods:</h2>
<p>
    The great thing about <code>ArrayList</code> is how easy it is to manipulate its elements. It has methods inherited from the
    <code>List</code>
    interface that allow us to easily add, remove, or access elements. As we modify the <code>ArrayList</code> with
    these
    methods, the elements automatically shift. This is another advantage an an <code>ArrayList</code> has over
    arrays, as for arrays we must write code to handle shifting of elements. Let's use some of the more common methods
    to
    manipulate our TODO list.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        //<code>ArrayList</code><String> Declaration
        <code>ArrayList</code><String> toDoList= new <code>ArrayList</code><String>();

        //Add method for String <code>ArrayList</code>
        toDoList.add("Finish Portfolio");
        toDoList.add("Finish AP Labs");
        toDoList.add("Work on Organic Chem Worksheet");
        toDoList.add("Study for History Test");
        toDoList.add("Make lunch");
        toDoList.add("Find old resume");
        toDoList.add("Finish English Essay");
        toDoList.add("Get some sleep");

        // if we want to insert an element at a specific index
        toDoList.add(2, "Work on ICS ISP");

        // Similar to .length, .size() returns the number of elements
        System.out.println("Number of things to do: "+ toDoList.size());

        // If we want to access a specific element
        System.out.println("Next up: "+ toDoList.get(0));

        // First TODO list
        System.out.println("TODO List: "+ toDoList);

        // Manuplation of our TODO list
        toDoList.set(1, "Finish Picture Lab"); // Replaces AP Labs
        toDoList.remove(7); // Removes element at index 7 (Yay we finished our essay)
        toDoList.remove("Finish Portfolio"); // Finally done!

        // Modified List
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("Number of things to do: "+ toDoList.size());
        System.out.println("Next up: "+ toDoList.get(0));
        System.out.println("TODO List: "+ toDoList);
    }
</pre>
</p>
<p>
    Outputs:
</p>
<table>
    <td>
        <pre>
Number of things to do: 9
Next up: Finish Portfolio
TODO List: [Finish Portfolio, Finish AP Labs, Work on ICS ISP, Work on Organic Chem Worksheet,
    Study for History Test, Make lunch, Find old resume, Finish English Essay, Get some sleep]

Number of things to do: 7
Next up: Finish Picture Lab
TODO List: [Finish Picture Lab, Work on ICS ISP, Work on Organic Chem Worksheet,
        Study for History Test, Make lunch, Find old resume, Get some sleep]
        </pre>
    </td>
</table>
