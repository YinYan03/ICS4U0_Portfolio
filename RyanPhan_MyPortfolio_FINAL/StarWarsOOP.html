<h1>Don't Fear the OOP: Star Wars Theme</h1>
<br>

<h3>Modified from Johannes Claerbout's "Don't Fear the OOP" Tutorial<br>
    Modded Version by Ryan Phan, Kevin Nguyen, and Seyone Chithrananda<br></h3>


<p>
    There are three different levels of this tutorial, coded by colour. <font color="blue">Blue is for those readers who
    want the most basic introduction.
    It is targeted at those who are unsure what object-oriented programming is, and could use a good analogy to make
    things clearer.
    <font color="purple">Purple is for those who want to be able to understand object-oriented programming just enough
        to be able to read and follow it,
        but are not yet ready to learn the intricacies of coding Java. <font color="red">And finally, the third level,
            red, is for you daredevils who want to be able to
            program in Java, but just want to ease into it slowly.
</p>

<p><font color="black">
    In short, <font color="blue">the blue text gives a "plain English" version of the code that would be necessary,
    <font color="purple">the purple uses that English in a way that more closely
        resembles the format of code, <font color="red">and the red is the actual code that would be necessary for the
            program to work. <font color="black">Readers of all levels are encouraged to
                skip between the colours to deepen their understanding. Finally, although this tutorial operates mostly
                through analogy, innuendo, and intrigue, those
                words that appear in <b>boldface</b> are the <i>actual terms used by Java programmers</i> (ooooh!), so
                try to remember them as you go along.

<p>
    Meet George Lucas. George makes Star Wars movies. His films about life a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away
    have become so popular that
    everybody rushes to see them. His fans are never disappointed, because George's movies are very consistent. How does
    he manage this?

<p>
    Well, before George writes anything, he sits down at his desk, sweeps aside the clutter, and places a single piece
    of paper down on his desk.
    It is on this one page that he writes his whole plot.

<p>
    How can George get the whole story onto one page? Simple. Everything he writes on the page is just a sequence of
    events, or plot.
    Setting, character development, and how his characters interact is all taken care of elsewhere. How does he do that?
    Let's find out.

<p>
    You see, George, more than anything else, is orderly and consistent. It's what has made his movies so popular.
    Let's say that he has just sat down to write "Laundry Day on a Death Star", his fifty-third film (he wants to milk
    the brand as much as possible).

<p>
    The first thing that George needs is a setting. So he pulls down a binder he has marked "Death Stars", opens to the
    first page, and reads the first few lines:


<table>
    <td>
        <font color="blue">A Death Star has many components: Barracks, Hangers, Officers, Stormtroopers,
            and a prison with some Rebel scum.
            A typical Death Star would have 4 hangers and is located near Geonosis sometime around 20 BBY.
    </td>
</table>

<p><font color="blue">
    Here we define the components and attributes of a Death Star, and we gave some of the attributes values that might
    occur in the typical Death Star.
</p>

<table>
    <td>
        <font color="purple"><pre>
DeathStar
	contains a specific number of barracks 
	contains a specific number of hangers
	contains a specific number of officers
	contains a specific number of stormtroopers
	contains a specific number of rebels
	contains a specific number of prisons
	is located at a specific place
	exists at a specific time
 
a typical DeathStar would have
	number of hangers = 4
	number of prisons = 1
	location = Above Geonosis
 
	time period in BBY = 20 
</pre>
    </td>
</table>

<p><font color="purple">
    Although George"s writing may seem puzzling at first, it"s actually very simple.
    The first line indicates that George is about to define a Death Star. When George writes more than one word, such as
    "DeathStar",
    he doesn"t use a space because his dyslexic wife needs to be able to understand what he is writing.

<p>
    After this, George will declare the types of variables (the entities which determine
    how the Death Star will look) that a class of Death Stars can have. Barracks, officers,
    stormtroopers, etc. Now, George will construct a sample Death Star with default variable values. <br>

    <font color="red"><pre class="prettyprint">
public class DeathStar
{
    int barracks;
    int hangers;
    int officers;
    int stormtroopers;
    int rebels;
    int prison;
    String location;
    int timeInBBY;

    public DeathStar ()
    {
        hangers = 3;
        prison = 1;
        location = "Above Geonosis";
        timeInBBY = 20;
    }
}
</pre>

<p><font color="red">
    While creating his Death Star, George is defining a class, not the Death Star itself (which is an object). A class
    is like a blueprint for a house, just without the measurements and details. It gives the general layout of a house,
    but no specifics.

<p>
    Here is where we declare what the variables will be called, and what sort of values they will contain. Right now all
    we have are "int" for our whole numbers and "String" for our letters and words.

<p>
    As for the semicolon, its purpose is to end the line, much like a period in English.

<p>
    You may have noticed that George tends to place curly braces("{") around his code. This just helps him organize his
    code, especially given how long his movies are. Any class will always end with all the open curly braces being
    closed.

<p>
    If George does create (instantiate) a Death Star object eventually in his movie, his editor will look to the same
    Death Star"s class to determine what that Death Star object should look like (George will send the binders along
    with his manuscript). But where will his editor find out the number of stables and such? This is where we get into
    the constructor.

<p>
    The constructor comes after all of the variables have been declared. It starts with public DeathStar(). The
    statements that follow are the default values for his variables; how George's town object would look if he simply
    instantiated it in his plot without specifying any of its values.

<p><font color="black">
    So now we've sneaked a peak at one of George's binders. he has reviewed the Death Star section and thinks that this
    film should take place in, not surprisingly, a Death Star. So he's ready to write the first part of his plot. George
    turns to the <b>main</b> paper that is sitting in the middle of his desk and starts to write the plot.

<p>
<table>
    <td>
        <font color="blue">
            Laundry Day on a Death Star

            The story takes place on a Death Star called Desire. Desire has five barracks, one hundred officers, one
            thousand stormtroopers, and four rebels.
</table>

<p><font color="blue">
    In these lines, George has answered a lot of questions about the Death Star. When he sends the story to LucasFilm,
    they will find "Death Star" in his binder and fill in the date, location, and number of hangars. George has also
    added statistics for the barracks, officers, stormtroopers, and rebels. LucasFilm was expecting George to do this
    (it"s impossible for him to find good help). Due to the fact that his binder said that all Death Stars would have a
    specific number of these, but didn't specify the exact amount, LucasFilm was overjoyed to see them clarified in his
    plot. The reference to his binder allows the plot to contain a lot of information in only a few lines.

    <table>
        <td>
            <font color="purple"><pre>
Laundry Day

Death Star desire is a new Death Star.

the number of barracks is five.
the number of officers is one hundred.
the number of stormtroopers is one thousand.
the number of rebels is four.
</pre></td>
    </table>

<p><font color="purple">
    George takes two critical steps at the start of his plot. He <b>instantiates an object</b> of type DeathStar. After
    creating the <b>object</b>, George fills out the specifics that were lacking in the DeathStar <b>class</b>: (number
    of barracks, officers, stormtroopers, rebels).

<p>

    <font color="red"><pre class="prettyprint">
public class LaundryDay {
    public static void main (String arguments[])
    {
        DeathStar desire = new DeathStar;
        desire.barracks = 5;
        desire.officers = 100;
        desire.stormtroopers = 1000;
        desire.rebels = 4;
    }
}
</pre>

<p><font color="red">
    The line containing "main" tells LucasFilm that this is his <b>main routine</b>, or plot.

<p>
    When assigning a value to the <b>variables</b> (barracks, etc) that were unspecified in the DeathStar <b>class</b>,
    George writes the name of the <b>object</b> (desire) followed by a period and then by the <b>variable</b> name.
    George then assigns a value for the variable, such as five.

<p><font color="black">
    So, believe it or not, you've just seen object-oriented programming in action. Our director and writer George first
    created a class (that was the binder) that roughly described a Death Star, then turned to his <b>main</b> plot page
    and created (<b>instantiated</b>) a Death Star <b>object</b>, which he then called desire.

<p>
    Now, for his Jedi, George needs a different binder. So he puts "Death Stars" back on the shelf, and goes to pick up
    a new binder. his hand passes over many different titles, like "Planets", "Shuttles", "Cruisers", "Music", all the
    essentials for a good Star Wars movie, until he finally comes to the binder he wants: "Humans". he opens up to the
    introduction:


<table>
    <td>
        <font color="blue">
            "All humans start out with two legs, two arms, two eyes, a nose, and a mouth.
            They are either male or female, have a name, have a droid with a name, and have
            different preferences in beverages. If someone asks, humans can respond with their name."
</table>

<p><font color="blue">
    George made all the body parts <b>variables</b>, which allows him to change their values later in the plot. As a
    veteran filmmaker, George knows that sob stories about disabled humans (like Darth Vader) bring in big bucks. He
    left the sex, name, droid name, and beverage preference unspecified so that all of his humans don't look identical.
    He does this since he prefers to specify those <b>variables</b> when he writes the plot.

    <table>
        <td>
            <font color="purple"><pre>
Humans
	have a specific number of legs 
	have a specific number of arms
	have a specific number of eyes
	have a specific number of noses
	have a specific number of mouths
	have a name
	have a specific sex
	have a droid with a name
	have a strong preference in beverage
 
A standard human would start with
	two legs
	two arms
	two eyes
	one nose
	one mouth
 
When someone asks for your name
	tell them your name
</pre>
    </table>


<p><font color="purple">
    George can ask a human their name, and they will respond. This is called a <b>method</b>.

<p>

    <font color="red"><pre class="prettyprint">
public class Humans
{
    int legs;
    int arms;
    int eyes;
    int nose;
    int mouth;
    String name;
    String sex;
    String droidName;
    String beveragePreference;

    public Humans ()
    {
        legs = 2;
        arms = 2;
        eyes = 2;
        nose = 1;
        mouth = 1;
    }

    public String whatIsYourName ()
    {
        return name;
    }
}
</pre>

<p><font color="red">
    The "public String whatIsYourName()" method specifies the behavior of a typical human. When that method is called,
    it will return the name of the specific human (As long as the variable is given a value).

<p><font color="black">
    As interesting as these descriptions of humans may be, however, they're not very specific. George promised LucasFilm
    a new story by Friday, so he decides to get down to business. Flipping through the "Humans" binder, he comes to the
    first chapter, entitled "Jedi".

<p>
<table>
    <td>
        <font color="blue">
            Jedi are based on the idea of humans. They are identical, except that they have some additional qualities,
            namely robes, a lightsaber, a specific "look", a beard, are force-sensitive, and will have saved a specific
            number of rebels. Your standard Jedi will have brown robes, start the day with their lightsaber, looks
            mysterious and will have a white beard, start with 100 midichlorians, and will have saved no rebels.
        </font></td></table>

<p><font color="blue">
    In George's binders, (<b>classes</b>) there are subsections (<b>subclasses</b>). This particular subsection, Jedi,
    extended the idea of humans.

<p>
    <table>
        <td>
            <font color="purple"><pre>

A Jedi
	has a beard.

For a given Jedi,
	He will look mysterious.
	He will start out with his lightsaber.
	He will have brown robes.
	He will have a white beard.
	He will start with 100 midichlorians.
</pre>
    </table>

<p>

    <font color="red"><pre class="prettyprint">
public class Jedi extends Humans
{

    String beardColour;
    String lightsaberColour;
    String robeColour;

    public Jedi ()
    {
        look = "mysterious";
        Lightsabers = 1;
        robeColour = "brown";
        beardColour = "white";
        numberOfRebels = 0;
        midichlorianCount = 100;
    }
}
</pre>

<p><font color="red">
    "Humans"; was a class, and "Jedi" a subclass of it.

<p>
    George declared "Humans rebel" in this class in order to let LucasFilm know that a rebel is a type of human.

<p><font color="black">
    After George had described what his Jedi looked like, he decides to move on to some of the <b>methods</b> that Jedi
    employ to do what Jedi do. Being a great writer, George wants to focus on how Jedi get so many midichlorians
    (Basically a measure of how strong your force powers are). So he writes:


    <table>
        <td>
            <font color="blue">
                Whenever the main plot says that a Jedi drinks blue milk, he gains a midichlorian.
            </font></td></table>

<p><font color="blue">
    Here, George specifies how one of his characters acts by changing the variable "midichlorianCount", rather than just
    changing how they appear. His binders (classes) can contain information about how characters act, allowing George to
    develop his characters without using the main plot.

    <table>
        <td>
            <font color="purple"><pre>
drinkBlueMilk
	midichlorianCount increases by one
</pre>
    </table>

<p><font color="purple">
    In the first line, George indicates what he is about to define (a <b>method</b> called drinkBlueMilk). On the
    following line, he writes what the method will do when he <b>calls</b> it in his <b>main</b> plot (<b>routine</b>).

</font>
<p>

    <font color="red"><pre class="prettyprint">
public void drinkBlueMilk ()  {
        midichlorianCount++;
    }
</pre>

<p><font color="red">
    First, George names the method "drinkBlueMilk". The method modifies the Jedi's level of midichlorians by adding one
    to it. That is what the "++" after "midichlorianCount" does.

<p><font color="black">
    Now, the Jedi in George's movies are famous for their high midichlorian count. Hence, it's very difficult for an
    onlooker to gauge how many midichlorians one of his Jedi has (You cannot really tell by looking at them). George
    decides that it's a good idea to allow his Jedi to state how many midichlorians he has, so he writes a new method:

    <table>
        <td>
            <font color="blue">
        If someone asks a Jedi how high his midichlorian count is, the Jedi will always respond with his midichlorian
        count.
            </font></td></table>

<p>
        <table><td>
            <font color="purple"><pre>
howManyMidichlorians
	tell them how many midichlorians I have
            </pre></font></td></table>

<p>

    <font color="red"><pre class="prettyprint">
public int howManyMidichlorians () {
        return midichlorianCount;
    }
</pre>

<p><font color="red">
    George puts int in the method declaration because the <b>method</b> has a <b>return value</b>. In order to let
    LucasFilm know what type of value was being returned, he specified "int" (for integer) in front of the method name.
    If he didn't tell LucasFilm what sort of variable this method was going to return, there would be a revolt against
    him (which is a bad thing, since George wants to keep LucasFilm running smoothly in hopes of one day selling it to
    Disney).

<p><font color="black">
    At this point George is pretty proud of himself, having created a Jedi that can experience pretty much the full
    range of Jedious activities. However, just to make for a good closing, George decides to have the Jedi have the
    ability to free a rebel. he sets out to write one more method. What makes this different than his other methods is
    that it needs information about someone other that the Jedi, namely the rebel to be freed. To allow for flexibility
    (and for a variety of rebels), George decides to leave the identity of the rebel blank for now.

    <table>
        <td>
            <font color="blue">
        If the Jedi is supposed to free a rebel, free the specified rebel, then add one to the number of rebels he has
        freed. Then print out "Alert! The Jedi has freed (the specified rebel)"
            </font></td></table>

<p><font color="blue">
    George leaves specific things to be clarified only when the plot is written, for example, by writing that the rebel
    will have a name, but not stating what it will be. The print statement prints out the information gathered by the
    method as an event in his movie.

    <table><td>
        <font color="purple"><pre>
freeRebel (name)
	add one to the number of rebels this Jedi has freed. 
	print "Alert! The Jedi has freed (the specified rebel)"
        </pre></font></td></table>

<p>

    <font color="red"><pre class="prettyprint">
public void freeRebel (Humans rebel){
        this.rebel = rebel;
        numberOfRebels++;
        System.out.println ("Alert! The Jedi has freed " + rebel.whatIsYourName ());
    }
</pre>

<p><font color="red">
    Between the parentheses in the method declaration, there is "Humans rebel", an argument, which makes the method more
    specific. George wants his Jedi to free a rebel at some point in the movie (what sort of Star Wars film would it be
    without it?), but if he just wrote in his "Jedi.freeRebel()", the viewer would be confused. Who has been freed? What
    is their name? George wants to add the name of the rebel who is being freed, so when his plot says "freeRebel", it
    will also state the name of the rebel being freed as an argument. "Humans" tells LucasFilm that the entity being
    freed is a human. LucasFilm knows that it is a human being freed, which reduces the amount of guesswork on their end
    (and we all know they"re terrible at that).

<p>
    The next line is another attempt by George to please the minimum-wage-earning producers at LucasFilm, who are never
    able to pull their own weight! Even though he has supplied the name of the rebel as an argument, LucasFilm won't let
    him use it in the method until he has stated that the "rebel" that he declared as a "Jedis" variable is equal to the
    value given in the method's argument.

<p>
    After jumping through all of his workforce"s hoops (don't expect to understand all of that right away, it took
    George a couple of hiring and firing sprees to get it right), George gets down to finishing the rest of his method.
    Once the Jedi has freed a rebel, the variable "freedRebels" will go up by one, so George puts the same "++" after
    freedRebels that he had put after "midichlorianCount" in the "drinkBlueMilk" example.

<p>
    With everything in place, George decides that it is time to let his beloved cash cows (viewers and fans) know what
    is going on using the "System.out.println" statement. It lets LucasFilm know that the text in between the
    parentheses and quotation marks goes into the final text of the script. On the other hand, the variable
    'rebel.whatIsYourName' is not in quotation marks because it is not a literal, but rather an <b>object's method</b>.
    George keeps it out of quotation marks to let LucasFilm know that they have to go look for the rebel object of the
    "Humans" class for the method "whatIsYourName" (they would see that it returned the rebel's name).

<p>
    If he had put rebel.whatIsYourName inside of the quotation marks, LucasFilm would have printed this in the script:
    "The Jedi has freed + rebel.whatIsYourName!". No Oscars for that! In order for LucasFilm to substitute the variable
    name with the word name, George closes the quotation marks before he writes it. The plus "+" lets LucasFilm know
    that he wants to join the two statements.

<p><font color="black">
    At this point, it might be a good idea to review what George's overall description of a Jedi looks like. None of
    this material is new, just a compilation of what we've gone over in the past few pages.

    All this work with rebels and imperial shuttles is making George feel a bit run down, so he decides to stop working
    on his characters for a little while, and to work a bit on the main plot.

<p>
    Accordingly, he sets his pen to the sheet of paper labeled <b>main routine</b>.

            Here is the main plot of the Laundry Day at the Western Hanger: There is a Death Star called Desire. Desire
            has five hangers, a thousand stormtroopers, and five rebels. There is a male Jedi named Ewan. Ewan has a
            blue lightsaber, a white beard, and a droid named "R2-D2". Ewan prefers blue milk. Leia is a female rebel.
            She has a droid named "C3-PO" and she likes eggnog. In our story, Maurice starts out by drinking blue milk.
            He then lets everyone know how many midichlorians he has (To scare the stormtroopers), and then saves Leia
            the rebel.

    "That's his movie?" you ask yourself. "Ten pages of slogging through ugly yellow text for this?"

<p>
    So what is so special about this plot? Well, it's not everything that's happening in the main routine, but rather
    everything that happens behind the scenes. When George created that Death Star called Desire, he created (<b>instantiated</b>)
    an <b>object</b> of type Death Star. This object had all the characteristics of a standard Death Star (do you
    remember the binders?) The same thing goes for the Ewan object and the Leia object. While some of the traits of
    these objects were specified at the time of creation, most of their traits were specified back in the binders, or
    classes. This allowed George to say a good deal while only saying a little bit in his <b>main routine</b>.

<p>
    So George's main plot (routine) turns out to be nothing more than a collection of references to objects, which in
    turn are references to classes. It is, to mix metaphors again, literary federalism, with everything being dealt with
    at the lowest level possible.

<p>
    So what are the benefits of this? Well, imagine that instead of one page, LucasFilm wanted a plot of five hundred
    pages. Or let's say that George decided that Ewan the Jedi shouldn't be so effective. Instead of going back and
    laboriously changing all his instances of Ewan protecting civilians and destroying Imperial propaganda, George could
    just make some changes to the Ewan object at the time of instantiation. Or he could change the Jedi class to be
    friendlier to the Empire. Or he could even create a *new* class, called FriendlyJedi with some aspects of the Samuel
    L. Jackson character in Pulp Fiction. He's got a lot of options; the point is that he only needs to make the changes
    in one place.

<p>
    But that's not George's only reason for writing his plots in Java. He has a keen idea for the future of Star Wars.
    He sees interactivity. And if, instead of being bound to the movie screen, his characters live in objects and
    classes, George is free to create a Virtual Desire. Fans (on his website) could be prompted for their own actions
    and his characters could respond in a variety of ways, according to what was written in their classes. Using Java,
    George could finally make Star Wars a reality. And hey, I'm sure he's not the only one yearning for ewoks, scraggly
    old men who can generate electricity, and planet-destroying war machines.

<p>
    <b>So what is LucasFilm?</b>

<p>
    You've seen many references to George's team at LucasFilm in San Francisco. Who are they? Well, he knows the world
    of Star Wars in and out, and he knows that specific things will just not work in a good Star Wars film. That is why
    his team at LucasFilm takes all of George's scripts, reads them, and then returns them with all the errors that he
    has made (remember, we said that he was a bit persnickety). On the computer, this is called a <b>compiler</b>. All
    Java programs must be <b>compiled</b> before they can be run. The compiler will patiently (and repeatedly) tell you
    everything that you did wrong. And then you get to go back and do it again. Hey, that's the filmmaking life.
