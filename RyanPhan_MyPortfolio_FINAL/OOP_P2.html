<h1>Object-Oriented Programming Part 2</h1>

<p>
    In Part 2, we'll be focusing on inheritance and polymorphism. We'll also touch upon
    abstraction.<br>
</p>

<h3>Inheritance</h3>

<h2>Superclass and Subclass</h2>
<p>
    Sometimes, when we are writing a program, we may find that some objects may share similar
    characteristics with each other. Think back to our Human class in OOP Part 1. Many different
    classes can share the characteristics of this Human class! For example, a student and a teacher
    would both share the characteristics of the Human class as they are both(presumably) humans! Even our
    student can be further broken down into a college student or a high school student! This means a class
    can serve as both as <strong>subclass</strong> and a <strong>superclass</strong>. Our subclasses
    are derived from other classes and superclasses are derived from. An easy way to figure
    out if you should make a subclass is to say: This [subclass] <strong>is a</strong>
    [superclass]. Does the statement make sense? <br> <br>
    For example, "A <code>Pigeon</code> is a <code>Bird</code>". This makes sense, so we can
    make the <code>Pigeon</code> class extend <code>Bird</code>.<br>
    <br>
    We call this relationship a <strong>IS-A</strong> relationship.
    However, remember that in Java, a class can only extend one subclass, though more than one subclass can
    extend the same superclass. <br><br>

    So why do we do this? Well we did mention that these objects share similar or even the same
    characteristics, so using inheritance would allow you to avoid code duplication. To do so we
    add the <code>extends</code> keyword and then the class we want to inherit in the class head.
    When we do this, the subclass inherits all of the methods and variables of the superclass. However,
    note that constructors <strong>CANNOT</strong> be inherited.

    Let's take a look at this in action:

<pre class="prettyprint">
    public class Human { // Superclass to Teacher and Student
        ...
    }

    public class Teacher extends Human { // Subclass to Human
        ...
    }

    public class Student extends Human { // Superclass to HighSchoolStudent & CollegeStudent
        ...
    }

    public class HighSchoolStudent extends Student { // Subclass to Student
        ...
    }

    public class CollegeStudent extends Student { // Subclass to Student
        ...
    }
</pre>
</p>
<p>
    Now you may be wondering, can a <code>HighSchoolStudent</code> or a
    <code>CollegeStudent</code> be considered <code>Human</code>? While we may be tempted
    to say no, as we know that classes can only extend one class (and because these students
    have an insane ability to get things done at the last minute), the answer is actually yes!
    Due to inheritance, <code>HighSchoolStudent</code> and <code>CollegeStudent</code> both
    have the properties of a <code>Human</code>! Both of these classes have a IS-A relationship
    with <code>Human</code>. This is why we call these classes objects!
    Every class is a subclass of the <code>Object</code> class, may it be directly or indirectly.
    This is great for us, as we can still access all of the properties a <code>Human</code> may
    have, without having to copy over code.
</p>

<h3>Polymorphism</h3>

<p>
    The ability to override a superclasses method in one of its subclasses is considered
    <strong>polymorphism</strong>. This allows us to create multiple objects that perform
    the same action in different ways. For example, a <code>speak()</code> method
    for a <code>Dog</code> may be entirely different from a <code>Cat</code>, even though
    both would be considered a <code>Mammal</code>.
    <br>
</p>
<h2>Overriding Methods</h2>
<p>
 To override a method, all we must do is create a method with the same name as the superclass's version,
    but with different implementation. And so, when we call this method using a subclass object,
    the overridden method will be used. Let's use our dog and cat example to demonstrate this.

<pre class="prettyprint">
public class Driver {
  public static void main(String [] args) {
    Mammal m = new Mammal();
    Dog d = new Dog();
    Cat c = new Cat();
    // We call the same method, but with different objects.
    m.speak();
    d.speak();
    c.speak();
  }
}

// Superclass
class Mammal {
  public void speak() {
    System.out.println("Mammal: *Mammal Sounds*");
  }
}

// Subclass
class Dog extends Mammal {
  public void speak() {
    System.out.println("Dog: *Woof*");
  }
}

// Subclass
class Cat extends Mammal {
  public void speak() {
    System.out.println("Cat: *Meow*");
  }
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    Outputs:
</p>
<table>
    <td>
        <pre>
Mammal: *Mammal Sounds*
Dog: *Woof*
Cat: *Meow*
        </pre>
    </td>
</table>

<p>
    As you can see, we have different output for the same method!
</p>
<h2>Upcasting And Downcasting</h2>
<p>
    When we cast a class, we are essentially giving it a different label. Just note that
    casting only works between objects with a IS-A relationship. <br> <br>

    Upcasting works because of this IS-A relationship, and thus it can never fail. This
    allows Java to upcast automatically as a subclass can always be upcasted into its
    superclass. <br><br>

    For example:
<pre class="prettyprint">
/*
 * Notice how we call the Subclass constructor?
 * This makes it an object of the Subclass, under the label
 * of the superclass.
 * [Superclass] identifier = new [Subclass]();
 */

Human h1 = new Teacher (); // Automatically upcasts to Human
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    This is especially useful when using objects as an argument.
    Thanks to automatic upcasting, any method which accepts a superclass as an
    argument, can also accept that superclass's subclasses as an argument.

<pre class="prettyprint">
public static void disappoint (Human h)
{
    System.out.println ("You disappointed the " + h);
}

public static void main(String[] args)
{
    Teacher t = new Teacher();
    disappoint(t); // Automatically gets upcasted to Human
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    The above will compile and run without any issues! However, remember that while
    <code>h1</code> is a <code>Teacher</code> object, it will be seen as a <code>Human</code>.
    This means that any attribute or method unique to the Teacher class cannot be accessed
    by <code>h1</code> until it is downcasted to a Teacher. <br><br>


    Downcasting can only be done manually, as not every object is capable of being
    downcasted into a subclass. If we had created <code>h1</code> using the <code>Human</code>
    constructor, attempting to downcast it to <code>Teacher</code> or
    <code>Student</code> would result in an error at runtime. This happens as it fails
    the IS-A relationship test. Is a human a teacher or a student? No! Both the <code>Teacher</code> or
    <code>Student</code> classes are subclasses of Human, and thus a Human object cannot
    be downcasted into them. Downcasting only works when it can pass the
    IS-A relationship test. Is a <code>Teacher</code> a <code>Student</code>? No,
    they are both subclasses of Human. Thus you cannot downcast a <code>Teacher</code> into a
    <code>Student</code>. Let's try to downcast our original upcast from a <code>Teacher</code>
    to a <code>Human</code>

<pre class="prettyprint">
    Human h1 = new Teacher (); // Automatically upcasts to Human
    Teacher t1 = h1; // Works! h1 is a Teacher object and thus the Human label can be downcasted
</pre>
</p>


<h3>Abstraction</h3>
<p>
    Abstraction is done to control what information is shown to the user, and typically, for
    a program, only the functionality is shown to the user while its implementation is hidden.
    This concept builds upon the idea of polymorphism in order to achieve this goal.
    The two ways of implementing abstraction are abstract classes and interfaces.<br>
</p>
<h2>Abstract Class</h2>
<p>
Abstract classes represent an abstract idea or concept of an object, and thus they are
created only to serve as superclasses. You would not create any instances of a
 abstract class. For example, when would you need to create an instance of a
    <code>Mammal</code>? A mammal serves as the concept for more concrete
    types of animals. While an abstract class can contain regular methods,
    these classes may also contain abstract methods, or methods with
    no useful default implementation. For example, our <code>speak()</code> method
    in <code>Mammal</code> serves no purpose, as it is too vague.
    Let's rewrite our <code>Mammal</code> code to use abstract methods.

<pre class="prettyprint">
public class Driver {
  public static void main(String [] args) {
    Dog d = new Dog();
    Cat c = new Cat();
    d.speak();
    c.speak();
  }
}

// Abstract classes are declared with the keyword abstract
abstract class Mammal {
  public abstract void speak(); // No implementation or braces
}

/** The following are our non-abstract subclasses **/

class Dog extends Mammal {
  public void speak() {
    System.out.println("Dog: *Woof*");
  }
}

class Cat extends Mammal {
  public void speak() {
    System.out.println("Cat: *Meow*");
  }
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>
    Outputs:
</p>
<table>
    <td>
        <pre>
Dog: *Woof*
Cat: *Meow*
        </pre>
    </td>
</table>
<p>
    Note that both of our subclasses implement the abstract methods of <code>Mammal</code>.
    If we forget to do this, a compile-time error will be thrown.
</p>

<h2>Interfaces</h2>
<p>
    Interfaces are similar to abstract classes, in which they act as superclasses
and cannot be instantiated. Interfaces contain a collection of abstract methods which
    <strong>must</strong> be implemented by its subclasses, otherwise you must declare
the subclass as abstract. There are some key difference between the two though, as
<ul class = "regList">
    <li>Abstract classes can contain instance variables, whereas interface cannot.</li>

    <li>Abstract classes can provide implementation code for its methods, while an interface cannot.</li>

    <li>You can only extend one abstract class, but you can implement multiple interfaces.</li>

    <li>To inherit an abstract class you use the extends keyword and for interfaces you use the implements word.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Interfaces can be used when multiple unrelated objects have a similar feature amongst them.
    For example, you could have an interface called <code>Flammable</code>, which could
    include classes like <code>Trees</code>, <code>Oil</code>, or <code>Hair</code>. In the
    below example, our interface is <code>PersonalInfo</code> implemented by <code>PersonRecord</code>.

<pre class="prettyprint">
import java.util.*;

interface PersonalInfo
{
    Calendar getFileCreationDate(); // No implementation
    int getCurrentAge(int birthYear); // No implementation
}

class PersonRecord implements PersonalInfo // Note the use of implements
{
    Calendar creationDate;
    int currentAge;

    public PersonRecord (Calendar creationDate)
    {
        this.creationDate = creationDate;
    }

    /** The following methods provide implementation for our abstract methods**/
    public Calendar getFileCreationDate ()
    {
        return creationDate;
    }

    public int getCurrentAge (int birthYear)
    {
        currentAge = Calendar.getInstance().get(Calendar.YEAR) - birthYear;
        return currentAge;
    }
}
</pre>
