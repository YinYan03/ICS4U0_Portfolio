<h3>Sorting Algorithms</h3>

<h2>Selection Sort</h2>

<p>
    A good way to think of objects is to think about how objects work in real life. Every object has
    <strong>attributes</strong>,
    that describe the object. For example, the attributes for a human would be their gender, hair colour, their weight,
    and so on.
    In programming terms, these attributes would take the form of <strong>instance variables</strong>. These instance
    variables would store the values of these attributes. <br>

<pre class="prettyprint">
    private String name;
    private String state;
    private String gender;
    private String hairColour;
    private int age;
    private int weight;
    private int height;
</pre>
</p>


<h2>Insertion Sort</h2>

<p>
    Similar to selection sort, insertion sort splits the array into two sections. <br>

<p> Here's our main method, but this time we'll use insertion sort to sort our arrays.
     <br>
<pre class="prettyprint">
    public static void main (String[]args)
    {
      insertionSort (new String []{"Andy", "Andrey", "Jefferson", "Jason", "Meghan"});
        System.out.println ();
        insertionSort (new int []{5, 6, 4, -3, 9, 3, -7});
    }
</pre>
</p>

<p> Here's our main method, but this time we'll use insertion sort to sort our arrays.
     <br>
	 
<pre class="prettyprint">
    // Sorts an array of ints using insertion sort.
    public static void insertionSort (int[] nums)
    {
        /*
           Initializes a variable called unsortedInt that will store each unsorted int for comparing and 
		   temporary storage purposes.
		 */
		int unsortedInt; 
        
        // Traverses the unsorted elements of the array.
        for (int x = 1; x < nums.length; x++) 
        {
            // Sets unsortedInt and the index of the sorted int that it is being compared to.
            unsortedInt = nums[x];
            int sortedIntIndex = x - 1;
            
            /*
			   Checks if the sorted int index is pointing at a valid index and checks if the element in the index is 
			   greater than the unsorted element.
               If both conditions are satisfied, the sorted int will be copied one element up in the array and the 
			   sortedIntIndex will point one index down.
             */
            while (sortedIntIndex >= 0 && nums [sortedIntIndex] >= unsortedInt) 
            {
                nums [sortedIntIndex + 1] = nums [sortedIntIndex];
                sortedIntIndex--;
            }
            /*
			   Places the unsortedInt into the index above the sorted int index. This will occur either when the 
			   sorted int index is pointing at -1 or at an int that is less than the unsorted int.
			 */
            nums [sortedIntIndex + 1] = unsortedInt;
        }
        // Prints all of the (now sorted) elements of the array.
        for (int y = 0; y < nums.length; y++)
        {
            System.out.print (nums[y] + " ");
        }
        // Adds a line break.
        System.out.println ();
    }
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Merge Sort</h2>

<p>
    A good way to think of objects is to think about how objects work in real life. Every object has
    <strong>attributes</strong>,
    that describe the object. For example, the attributes for a human would be their gender, hair colour, their weight,
    and so on.
    In programming terms, these attributes would take the form of <strong>instance variables</strong>. These instance
    variables would store the values of these attributes. <br>

<pre class = "prettyprint">
    private String name;
    private String state;
    private String gender;
    private String hairColour;
    private int age;
    private int weight;
    private int height;
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Sample Problems</h2>
<p>
    Now that we understand how arrays work, let's work our way through a sample problem using arrays. <br>
	Write a program using methods and parameters to do all of the following:
<ol>
<li>	
 Input a list of names and corresponding  marks (1 mark per name) from the file A7-1.txt from the Pickup folder. 
 Assign data to arrays. Output the original data to the console in 2 columns with 5 spaces apart. <br><br>                                        
</li> 

<li>
 Sort the data alphabetically by name, using insertion, selection, or merge sort, and output the data to the console in columns.  
 Make sure that the name and the corresponding mark stay together. <br><br> 
</li> 
<li>
 Sort the data numerically, from largest to smallest, by mark, using insertion, selection, or merge sort, and output the data to the console in columns. 
 Make sure that the name and the corresponding mark stay together. <br><br> 
</li>
</ol>
