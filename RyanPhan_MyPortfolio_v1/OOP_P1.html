<h1>Object-Oriented Programming Part 1</h1>

<p>
    To draw out the most of Java's capabilities, one must understand the concept of <strong>Object-Oriented Programming
    (OOP)</strong>.
    In OOP, there are three main concepts to grasp: objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. Let's focus on objects
    first. <br>
</p>

<h2>Creating a Human using Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
<p>
    A good way to think of objects is to think about how objects work in real life. Every object has
    <strong>attributes</strong>,
    that describe the object. For example, the attributes for a human would be their gender, hair colour, their weight,
    and so on.
    In programming terms, these attributes would take the form of <strong>instance variables</strong>. These instance
    variables would store the values of these attributes. <br>

<pre class = "prettyprint">
    private String name;
    private String state;
    private String gender;
    private String hairColour;
    private int age;
    private int weight;
    private int height;
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    Notice how our instance variable are set to private? We do this to prevent others from directly accessing our human's
    attributes. As a result, this gives us(the programmer) more control over the accessibility of these variables and
    makes it easier to maintain or edit our code. This concept is known as <strong>encapsulation</strong>.
    In order to access/change these variables we will  need to use accessor and mutator methods, which will be
    explained more in depth in the next few paragraphs.<br>

</p>


<p>
    Every object also has a set of <strong>behaviours</strong>. These behaviours are
    used to manipulate and to access different components of the object. In our human example, they might want to change
    their hair colour. To do so they would use a <strong>mutator method</strong>, or a "setter" method to change their
    hair colour. This method would then take in a colour and assign that colour to the hair colour variable. Here is an
    example of a mutator method:<br>

    <pre class = "prettyprint">
    public void setHairColour(String hairColour) {
        this.hairColour = hairColour;
    }
</pre>
<br>
</p>

<p>
    Now what if somebody asks our friend Dave, "What's your hair colour?". Dave needs to reply, but how? He would use <strong>accessor methods</strong>.
    These methods return the values of our instance variables for whatever purpose we need it. Now Dave can tell everybody about his
    new hair colour! Note that instead of "void", we now put "String". Why? Well this section of the method header is the return
    type of the method. "void" simply means the method will return nothing. You can put any data type in the return section,
    like "int" or even a "Human"!

<pre class = "prettyprint">
 public String getHairColour() {
        return hairColour;
    }
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    Great! Now our human can take on different attributes and behaviours! Now how do make a human? For that, we would call our
    <strong>constructor</strong>, which is typically created at the top of our class.

<pre class = "prettyprint">
     /*
      * This is our constructor! We call the default one (no args)
      * or we can call this one, which allows you to set
      * some variables as you construct your human.
      */
    public Human (String name, String gender, int age)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.gender = gender;
        this.age = age;
    }
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    Now let's give our human the ability to perform human actions! To do this, we simply create some methods!

<pre class = "prettyprint">
    public void sleep()
    {
        state = "Well rested!";
    }

    public void grow(int growth)
    {
        height += growth;
    }

    public String jump(double jumpHeight)
    {
        return getName() + " jumped " + jumpHeight + " feet in the air!";
    }

    public String jump(String direction, double distance)
    {
        return getName() + " jumped " + direction + " " + distance + " feet";
    }

</pre>
</p>

<p>
    As you may have noticed we have two "jump" methods! This is called method overloading, which essentially allows you
    to create two methods with the same name, so long they have different arguments in the () section of the method header.
</p>

<p>
    And that's that! Now we have all the pieces needed to create an object in Java!
    Now all we must do is wrap these pieces in a class, or the blueprint for an object. In this case,
    our Human class will serve as the template for any human we choose to create!

<pre class = "prettyprint">
/*
 * Example: Human Class
 * This class contains the variables (attributes) and methods (behaviours) of a human.
 */
public class Human {
    // These are our variables!
    private String name;
    private String state;
    private String gender;
    private String hairColour;
    private int age;
    private int weight;
    private int height;

    /*
     *
     */
    public Human (String name, String gender, int age)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.gender = gender;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getState() {
        return state;
    }

    public void setState(String state) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public String getGender() {
        return gender;
    }

    public void setGender(String gender) {
        this.gender = gender;
    }

    public String getHairColour() {
        return hairColour;
    }

    public void setHairColour(String hairColour) {
        this.hairColour = hairColour;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }

    public int getWeight() {
        return weight;
    }

    public void setWeight(int weight) {
        this.weight = weight;
    }

    public int getHeight() {
        return height;
    }

    public void setHeight(int height) {
        this.height = height;
    }

    public void sleep()
    {
        state = "Well rested!";
    }

    public void grow(int growth)
    {
        height += growth;
    }

    public String jump(double jumpHeight)
    {
        return getName() + " jumped " + jumpHeight + " feet in the air!";
    }

    public String jump(String direction, double distance)
    {
        return getName() + " jumped " + direction + " " + distance + " feet";
    }

}
</pre>
</p>

    Now how exactly do we create our friend Dave, who just so happens to be a 32 year old man?
    Well let's create him in our driver class, which is typically used to run
    all of the other classes in a main method. To do this, we use the keyword  <code>new</code> to create
    a <strong>instance</strong> of a class. Try running the below code in your IDE of choice!

<pre class = "prettyprint">
/*
 * Dave Class
 * This class creates a Human called Dave and outputs his name, gender, and age. He also changes
 * his hair colour along the way.
 */
public class Dave {
  /*
   * Our main method. This is where we actually create/run everything we wrote in other classes.
   */
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    // Recall our constructor header was public Human (String name, String gender, int age)
    Human dave = new Human("Dave", "male", 32);
    dave.setHairColour("black");
    System.out.println ("Who are you?");
    System.out.println ("My name is " + dave.getName() + " and I am a " + dave.getAge()
    + " y/o " + dave.getGender() + ".");
    System.out.println ("What's your hair colour?");
    System.out.println ("Can't you see? It is " + dave.getHairColour()
    + ". Maybe I should make it blue...");
    dave.setHairColour("blue");
    System.out.println ("Now it is " + dave.getHairColour() + "!");
    System.out.println (dave.jump(2));
    System.out.println (dave.jump("forward", 4) + " out of sheer happiness!");
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
    Which outputs:
</p>

<table>
    <td>
    <pre>
Who are you?
My name is Dave and I am a 32y/o male.
What's your hair colour?
Can't you see? It is black. Maybe I should make it blue...
Now it is blue!
Dave jumped 2.0 feet in the air!
Dave jumped forward 4.0 feet out of sheer happiness!
    </pre>
    </td>
</table>
<p>
    So there we have it! Now that we know the basics of how objects work, we can get into some more interesting concepts.
