<h1>Object-Oriented Programming Part 2</h1>

<p>
    In Part 2, we'll be focusing on inheritance and polymorphism. We'll also touch upon
    abstraction.<br>
</p>

<h3>Inheritance</h3>

<h2>Superclass and Subclass</h2>
<p>
    Sometimes, when we are writing a program, we may find that some objects may share similar
    characteristics with each other. Think back to our Human class in OOP Part 1. Many different
classes can share the characteristics of this Human class! For example, a student and a teacher
would both share the characteristics of the Human class as they are both(presumably) humans! Even our
student can be further broken down into a college student or a high school student! This means a class
    can serve as both as <strong>subclass</strong> and a <strong>superclass</strong>. Our subclasses
    are derived from other classes and superclasses get derived from. Even <code>Object</code> is
    a class! Every class in Java is is implicitly a subclass of the Object class. <br>

    So why do we do this? Well we did mention that these objects share similar or even the same
    characteristics, so using inheritance would allow you to avoid code duplication. To do so we
    add the <code>extends</code> keyword and then the class we want to inherit in the class head.
    When we do this, the subclass inherits all of the methods and variables of the superclass. However,
    note that constructors <strong>CANNOT</strong> be inherited.

Let's take a look at this in action:

<pre class = "prettyprint">
    public class Human { // Superclass to Teacher and Student
        ...
    }

    public class Teacher extends Human { // Subclass to Human
        ...
    }

    public class Student extends Human { // Superclass to HighSchoolStudent & CollegeStudent
        ...
    }

    public class HighSchoolStudent extends Student { // Subclass to Student
        ...
    }

    public class CollegeStudent extends Student { // Subclass to Student
        ...
    }
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Polymorphism</h3>

<p>
    A good way to think of objects is to think about how objects work in real life. Every object has
    <strong>attributes</strong>,
    that describe the object. For example, the attributes for a human would be their gender, hair colour, their weight,
    and so on.
    In programming terms, these attributes would take the form of <strong>instance variables</strong>. These instance
    variables would store the values of these attributes. <br>

<pre class = "prettyprint">
    private String name;
    private String state;
    private String gender;
    private String hairColour;
    private int age;
    private int weight;
    private int height;
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Abstraction</h3>

<h2>Abstract Classes and Methods</h2>
<pre class = "prettyprint">
    private String name;
    private String state;
    private String gender;
    private String hairColour;
    private int age;
    private int weight;
    private int height;
</pre>
